## Leaderboard

This project includes a simple client-side leaderboard using `localStorage`.

- Open `index.html` and use the Leaderboard panel at the top-right.
- Enter a name and either provide a score or leave the score field empty to use your current in-game score, then click `Submit`.
- You can `Export` and `Import` the leaderboard as JSON, or `Clear` it to remove all entries.

Data is stored locally in your browser under the key `fish_leaderboard_v1`.
